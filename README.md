# Krugal's Labyrinth


## Description

"Krugal's Labyrinth" is a first-person survival horror game set in a dark, desolate maze. A monster prowls the labyrinth, relentlessly pursuing the player with the goal of elimination. Players cannot directly fight the monster but can use scattered bear traps to temporarily immobilize it. Each maze is procedurally generated, offering a unique experience every session. Unlike traditional mazes, thereâ€™s no clear exit; instead, players must navigate from the center of the labyrinth to locate a structure with a green-lit pillar at the top, marking the finish line.
